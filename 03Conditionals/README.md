### Comparing Integers

```
num1 -eq num2                  check if 1st  number is equal to 2nd number
num1 -ge num2                  checks if 1st  number  is greater than or equal to 2nd number
num1 -gt num2                  checks if 1st  number is greater than 2nd number
num1 -le num2                  checks if 1st number is less than or equal to 2nd number
num1 -lt num2                  checks if 1st  number  is less than 2nd number
num1 -ne num2                  checks if 1st  number  is not equal to 2nd number
```

### Comparing Strings

```
var1 = var2                    checks if var1 is the same as string var2
var1 != var2                   checks if var1 is not the same as var2
var1 < var2                    checks if var1 is less than var2
var1 > var2                    checks if var1 is greater than var2
-n var1                        checks if var1 has a length greater than zero
-z var1                        checks if var1 has a length of zero
